___Methods___ are methods much like standard Scala. They consist
of a name, zero or more parameters, return type, 
and an expression scope. They are designed to capture common
code within analysis instances for:
* Reduced Hydra source redundancy/complexity
* Increased JIT effectiveness
* Support for features where methods can be executed once and
the results shared across analysis queries.
