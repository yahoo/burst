___Topology___ is Fabric support for a  distributed data processing environment. 
Topology is designed for cloud/container deployment, specifically [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). 

###### Key Principles

* __loose coupling__ -- between masters and workers 
* __smart workers__  -- processing smarts pushed to workers, high level declarative languge based communication
* __dumb masters__  -- masters focus on worker vectoring and load balancing
* __dynamic worker counts__ -- failure resilience, load balancing
