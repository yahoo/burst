# Felt
___Felt___ is the **F**unctional **E**xecution **L**anguage **T**oolkit
-- a semantic object model that can byte code generate the artifacts necessary
to execute a behavioral analysis scan.

### Felt and Hydra
The Felt semantic
model has an innate string representation (grammar/syntax) that is
defined and supported by the [Hydra](../burst-ginsu/readme.md)  module.
Felt and Hydra both understand and support that string representation
in their own way and for their own purposes,
but it is Hydra where the lexer and parser is hosted.
Hydra acts as the internal execution API for submitting Hydra/Felt
scans and has an [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) based parser that is used to
construct Felt semantic object models from string representations
as well as submit the **Wave** (distributed execution)
requests to the [Fabric](../burst-fabric/readme.md)
process layer. Additionally Felt has the inherent ability to generate
any Felt semantic model as Hydra source. More on this later...

### Felt and EQL
Felt (and the Hydra string form) are lower level execution
languages more on a par with
a relational 'plan' or procedural implementation specification. Generally
speaking it is meant to be generated by a higher level more declarative
language. Burst provides such a language in [EQL](../burst-eql/readme.md).
Except for various specialized applications it is assumed that EQL is the
front end for Hydra. The future may hold provide other front ends and
there might be some who want to program directly in Hydra/Felt.

### Felt and Fabric
[Fabric](../burst-fabric/readme.md) is the Burst distributed execution
framework. Hydra/Felt generate Fabric compatible execution artifacts
and rely on Fabric dataset management to load data appropriately
on workers, and perform the appropriate scans on workers,
as well as hierarchical merges
from workers to supervisor for final results processing. Generally
What this translates to is that  Hydra knows how to turn Hydra source into
an appropriate Fabric scanners and submit those scanners along with
the appropriate data loading commands.

### Felt and Brio
Felt semantics are based on the [Brio](../burst-brio/readme.md) data model
semantics. All Felt trees require a single Brio Schema be provides
and all generated code conforms to that data model. This is a fairly deep
relationship since Felt code generates the traversal structures for the
Brio [Lattice](../burst-felt/src/main/scala/org/burstsys/felt/model/lattice/readme.md)
to create the low level mechanically efficient single pass scan of a Brio format
binary encoded object tree `blob` that Burst behavioral analysis depends on.
